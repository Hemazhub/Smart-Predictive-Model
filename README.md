# Smart-Predictive-Model
# Predictive Modeling for Rental  Property Prices
# Technologies Used: Cleansing, EDA, Visualization, ML
# Domain: Real Estate & Property Management

# Problem Statement:
In the real estate industry, determining the appropriate rental price for a property is crucial for property owners, tenants, and property management companies. Accurate rent predictions can help landlords set competitive prices, tenants make informed rental decisions, and property management companies optimize their portfolio management.

The goal of this project is to develop a data-driven model that predicts the rental price of residential properties based on relevant features. By analyzing historical rental data and property attributes, the model aims to provide accurate and reliable rent predictions.

# Expected Outcomes:
The successful implementation of the house rent prediction model will provide property owners, tenants, and property management companies with a tool to estimate rental prices accurately. This will enhance transparency, aid in decision making, and contribute to a more efficient and equitable rental market.

# Key Tasks:
*1. Data Preprocessing:*
   Clean and preprocess the features and historical rental prices data, handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables.
*2. Feature Selection and Engineering:*
   Identify key features that significantly influence rental prices. Perform feature engineering to create new informative features, such as proximity scores to important facilities.
*3. Model Selection:*
   Choose appropriate regression algorithms for the task, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, or neural networks. Consider ensembling or stacking multiple models for improved performance.
*4. Model Training and Evaluation:*
   Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train the selected models on the training data. Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., mean squared error, mean absolute error) on the testing data.
